Database project: Retailer.
The task was to create and organize database for retailer. I construct an E-R diagram representing the conceptual design of the database. 
Then create the relations in PostgreSQL database.
Also we have to Populate Relations, so i include enough data to database.
Then run some queries such
• What are the 20 top-selling products at each store?
• What are the 20 top-selling products in each state?
• What are the 5 stores with the most sales so far this year?
• In how many stores does Coke outsell Pepsi? (Or, a similar query for enterprises that don’t
sell soda.)
• What are the top 3 types of product that customers buy in addition to milk? (Or similar
question for nonfood enterprises.)
